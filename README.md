# README

Welcome to Maia Technology's technical test for prospective Software Engineers.

# How do I submit my solution?

The process goes something like:

* Create a private fork of our bitbucket repository. Please add your name to the end of the forked repo eg "dev_coding_test_stephen",
* Clone your private fork onto your personal computer,
* Write your unit tests and code,
* Create a file with instructions we can use to run your unit tests, build your app and execute your app.
* Commit and push your changes in the master branch to Bitbucket
* Add permission to view your code
	 * Go to settings 
	 * User and group access 
	 * Add skurlow@maiatechnology.com.au as Admin 
* Notify the relevant person that your solution is ready for review.
