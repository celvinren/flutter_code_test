# README

Welcome to Maia Technology's technical test for prospective Software Engineers.

Please read the documents in the docs folder to understand:

* The problem that needs to be solved,
* An input file that can be processed by your solution to the technical test,
* Specification for the input file's data format.
# How do I submit my solution?

* Create a private fork of our bitbucket repository. Add your name to the end of the forked repo eg "dev_coding_test_stephen",
* Clone your private fork onto your computer
* Write your unit tests and code
* Create a file with instructions on how to run your unit tests, build, and execute your app.
* Commit and push your changes to bitbucket
* Give ptaylor@maiatechnology.com.au permission to view the repo
* Notify the relevant person that your solution is ready to review, including the
	* the links to your repo and/or repl.it environment 
	* along with access and other instructions

# What we'll look for 

Treat the exercise as a conversation starter that we'll use to talk about different software engineering concepts. 

In line with good agile practices, start with a small slice of functionality that can run properly and can be delivered. Add on functionality as you go.

We don't expect candidates to spend more than a couple hours working on the exercise. Help us understand your thought process with comments, clear abstractions, tests, and code.

Other nice things we're looking for: 
* Domain Driven Design
* Clean code
* Layered software design

# What technologies can I use?

Below are different focus areas. Depending on what area you're applying for, choose technologies you're comfortable with and would like to showcase.

## Front-End JavaScript Developer

If you are applying for a front-end Javascript developer position then please develop your solution using:

* VueJS, AngularJS or React preferably using Typescript
* npm

Use the opportunity to show:
* Component design with clean prop/event interfaces
* State management
* UI/UX design

Notes:
* The input file can be read directly in the code without a file upload form.

## Full-Stack Java Developer

If you are applying for a full-stack Java developer position then please develop your solution using:

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven

Expose the solution as an API.

Consume the API on a simple web page that shows the answer to the problem using your choice of framework such as those listed in the Front-End Developer description.

## Mobile App Developer

If you are applying for a mobile app developer position then please develop your solution using one of these choices:

* NativeScript Angular/Vue for either iOS/Android
* Flutter for iOS/Android
* React Native for iOS/Android
* Swift for iOS
* Kotlin for Android
