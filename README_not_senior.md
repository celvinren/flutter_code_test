# README for a Non-Senior role

IMPORTANT: Please first read the file README.md

Welcome to Maia Technology's technical test for prospective Software Engineers.

Please read the documents in the docs folder to understand:

* The problem that needs to be solved,
* An input file that can be processed by your solution to the technical test,
* Specification for the input file's data format.

# What is important to us?

We look for evidence of Domain Driven Design (DDD), clean code, layered software design. As an example see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwJRrJ2Hwqg

# What technologies can I use?

This depends on whether you are applying for a front-end JavaScript developer, full-stack Java developer or mobile app developer position.

## Front-End JavaScript Developer

If you are applying for a front-end Javascript developer position then please develop your solution using:

* VueJS, AngularJS or React preferably using Typescript
* npm

Please use the opportunity to:

* Not only solve the problem which can involve simply reading the input file from inside the browser (no need for a back-end REST API),
* Show off your UI Design, CSS skills. We are looking for wow factor skills in terms of great UX and UI Design.
* No need to build a UI that accepts a file uploaded from a computer's local filesystem.

Can you visually show the problem's answer on the screen with a little creative flair - attractive aesthetics? Inspiration perhaps at https://www.awwwards.com/websites/clean/

## Full-Stack Java Developer

If you are applying for a full-stack Java developer position then please develop your solution using:

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven

There is a bonus if you can demonstrate your front-end HTML/CSS/Typescript skills.
You can give it a simple web page that shows the answer to the problem using your choice of framework such as:

* VueJS
* AngularJS
* React

## Mobile App Developer

If you are applying for a mobile app developer position then please develop your solution using one of these choices:

* NativeScript Angular/Vue for either iOS/Android
